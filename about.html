        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Mountains are majestic landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, typically with steep slopes and significant elevation. They cover around 22% of the Earth's land surface and play vital roles in shaping landscapes, climates, and cultures.
          
          Here are some key points about mountains:
          
          Formation: Mountains can form through various geological processes, including tectonic activity (like the collision of tectonic plates), volcanic activity, and erosion. Some of the world's highest peaks, like Mount Everest and the Himalayas, formed through tectonic plate collisions, while others, like Mount Fuji in Japan, are volcanic in origin.
          
          Types: There are different types of mountains, including fold mountains (formed by the folding of rock layers due to tectonic forces), fault-block mountains (formed when blocks of the Earth's crust move vertically along faults), and volcanic mountains (formed by the accumulation of volcanic material).

        <h3>About Mountain</h3>
        <p>
          A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.[1]

          Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,[1] which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years.[2] Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.[3]
